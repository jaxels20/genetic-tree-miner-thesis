## 📖 Description

This repository accompanies our research on process discovery, introducing an enhanced genetic algorithm to generate accurate and interpretable process models from event logs. The approach is benchmarked on multiple real-life datasets and compared to existing methods.

## 🔧 Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/jaxels20/genetic-tree-miner.git
   cd genetic-tree-miner
   ```
2. Install Dependencies
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. Build FastTokenBasedReplay (make sure cmake, pybind11, and gtest are installed)
   ```bash
   cd src/FastTokenBasedReplay/
   mkdir build && cd build
   cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ..
   make
   cd ../../..
   ```
   
## ▶️ Usage
  ```bash
    python3 GTM.py --log_path logs/2013-cp.xes --output_path output.pdf --max_generations 5
  ```

## 📊 Datasets
The repository includes several real-life event logs from the 4TU Centre for Research Data. These are located in the event_logs/ folder and are in .xes format. However, please note that due to size limitations, only a subset of the event logs are included here, but they can all be downloaded [HERE](https://www.tf-pm.org/resources/logs) and put into the event log folder.

## 🧪 Reproducibility
Each script in produce_figures/ and produce_data/ generates a specific result from the paper, eg.
  ```bash
    # Generate Figure 5a
    python3 produce_figures/generate_figure_5a.py
    
    # Generate Table 2
    python3 produce_figures/generate_table_2.py
  ```
